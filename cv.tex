	\ecvitem{2014--2017}{
		\textbf{Bachelor's degree}\\&
		Czech Technical University in Prague, Prague
		(Czech Republic)\\&
		Branch of study: Computer Science,
		\textit{Graduated with honours}\\&
		Thesis:
		\textbf{Deep Learning in Large Astronomical Spectra Archives}\\&
		\textit{My bachelor's thesis aimed to find emission-line
			spectra using deep learning. Firstly,
			I trained and compared two neural
			networks (dense and VGG-like convolutional network)
			on spectral data from Ondřejov telescope.
			Then I used the convolutional network to classify
			spectra from a huge LAMOST archive and that led to
			a discovery of yet unknown stars with interesting
			physical properties.}\\&

		Application of Neural Networks to Stellar Spectra\\&
		\textit{After I finished my bachelor thesis there was still
			a lot of work to be done therefore I started to work
			on an application of different neural network types
			to stellar spectra. I also did also a great amount of
			work in preprocessing and balancing domain.}

	\ecvsection{Oral presentations}
	\ecvitem{Mar 2018}{
		\textbf{Reinforcement Learning in Recommendation:
		Off-policy Policy Evaluation}.
		Presentation at the meeting of
		Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence Group (ML-CIG),
		Prague.\\&
		\textit{This presentation addressed the problem of evaluation
			of new policy from off-line data in order to ascertain
			that it can be safely deployed. The problem was shown
			from point of view of both contextual bandits and full
			reinforcement learning formalization. I presented
			algorithms for off-policy policy evaluation
			as direct method, inverse propensity score,
			double robust estimator, important sampling and other
			modification of these methods.}

	\ecvitem{Jun 2017}{
		\textbf{Deep Learning in Large Astronomical Archives}.
		Bachelor's thesis presented at Symposium 14 - Astroinformatics:
		From big data to understanding the universe at large,
		European Week of Astronomy and Space Science (EWASS 2017),
		Prague.\\&
		\textit{Talk about my bachelor's thesis presented at the
			largest
			European astronomical conference. I focused the talk
			on domain adaptation and imbalanced learning.
			Firstly, I emphasized the problem of domain adaptation,
			which means using data from a different telescope to
			train
			a machine learning algorithm to classify spectra from
			totally different telescope. Secondly, I talk about
			the challenge of imbalanced learning because
			interesting objects are usually in minority therefore
			are difficult to learn about. I proposed SMOTE as a
			solution which I verify experimentally in my work.}

		The format is usually two short talks followed by discussion.
		I am a regular visitor and I already had two talks about
		\textit{Transfer Learning} and \textit{Deep Q-Network}.
