		\textit{My bachelor's thesis pointed out benefits of using
		Machine Learning in Astronomy.
		Therefore, I started to work
		on an application of different neural network types
		to stellar spectra which also included a great amount of
		work in preprocessing and data balancing domains.}

		Supervisor: RNDr. Petr Škoda, CSc.\\&
		\textit{My bachelor's thesis aimed to find emission-line
		spectra using deep learning. Firstly,
		I trained and compared two neural networks
		(dense and VGG-like convolutional network)
		on spectral data from Ondřejov telescope.
		Then I used the convolutional network to classify
		spectra from a huge LAMOST archive.
		The result showed that the network is able to
		discover yet unknown stars with interesting physical
		properties.}

		\textit{Presentation which addressed the evaluation problem
		of new policy from off-line data in order to ascertain
		that it can be safely deployed.
		I showed the problem from point of view of both contextual
		bandits and full reinforcement learning formalization.
		I presented different algorithms for off-policy policy
		evaluation as direct method, inverse propensity score,
		double robust estimator, important sampling and other
		modification of these methods.}

		Bachelor's thesis presented at Symposium 14 -- Astroinformatics:
		From big data to understanding the universe at large,
		European Week of Astronomy and Space Science (EWASS 2017),
		Prague.\\&
		\textit{Talk about my bachelor's thesis presented at the
		largest
		European astronomical conference. I focused the talk
		on domain adaptation and learning from imbalanced data.
		Firstly, I emphasized the problem of domain adaptation,
		which using data from a different telescope tries to
		train a machine learning algorithm to classify spectra from
		a totally different telescope.
		Secondly, I talk about the challenge of imbalanced learning
		because interesting objects are usually in minority therefore
		are difficult to learn about and identify.
		I proposed SMOTE as a solution which I experimentally verified.}
